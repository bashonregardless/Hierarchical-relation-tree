-----------------------------------

Steps to produce data consumable by the program from file data.js (currently in
test-data/data.js):

$ node $(find . -name 'flow-algo.js') > data.json

(If necessary)
quote your string in data.txt file, so that it becomes a single argument:
	$ ~/compSc/quoteStr.sh [file]

To work with data other than the default, change `const state = require('./path/to/file')`
line in flow-algo.js to one of the files in test-data/ directory.

-----------------------------------

Output of flow-algo process is imported in the file src/js/store/index.js
